# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

As much time as is required.  I start as soon as I can to allow for weeks
when the work is harder and takes longer.  

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far I am struggling with everything.  Persistence is the only thing I am doing well 
at the moment.  Going slowly and taking in as much as I can.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop being so hard on myself.  I have always struggled with learning and to have
gotten this far I am proving to myself I can do it if I put the work in.  I just need to put 
more work in than most people

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I know I take longer for things to sink in, I have learned to allow for this and put more effort in.  
So it is not that I am actually doing things poorly, it is that my memory works poorly.  
I do get there in the end though

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

spending the time required.  I am putting myself in locations (like the JCU Library) where
I can switch off to the outside world (except when there are students talking and laughing the whole time I am there)
I am doing most of my work in locations where I have access to 2 monitors.  I google and ask lots of questions,
and I am constantly going over my lecture and notes.
